    <failure message="Cypress detected a cross origin error happened on page load:

  &gt; Blocked a frame with origin &quot;https://classic.crmpro.com&quot; from accessing a cross-origin frame.

Before the page load, you were bound to the origin policy:

  &gt; https://crmpro.com

A cross origin error happens when your application navigates to a new URL which does not match the origin policy above.

A new URL does not match the origin policy if the &apos;protocol&apos;, &apos;port&apos; (if specified), and/or &apos;host&apos; (unless of the same superdomain) are different.

Cypress does not allow you to navigate to a different origin URL within a single test.

You may need to restructure some of your test code to avoid this problem.

Alternatively you can also disable Chrome Web Security in Chromium-based browsers which will turn off this restriction by setting { chromeWebSecurity: false } in `cypress.json`.
